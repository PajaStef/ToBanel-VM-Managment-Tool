Its just a cool project I made to test my skills. if you want full details go: https://www.pavlestefanovic.com/projects.html

You will need to install php package and jq package for the panel to work

This projcets uses the ProxMox API to create, manage and change VM configurations. To get this working you will need to go into every file and set how your proxmox is setup, you will need to set API keys, paths to the shell scripts and so on. So just make sure you went to every file and changed whats needed and thats it it should work just fine. 

For this project I used PHP HTML and Bash.
